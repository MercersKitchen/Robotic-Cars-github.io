Note
- Car Program: 05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car/05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car.ino
- Remote Program: Sketches/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller.ino

# First Step: Upload all libraries
- [ ] Open one of the programs below
      - Car Program: 05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car/05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car.ino
      - Remote Program: Sketches/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller.ino
- [ ] Sketch / Include Library / Add .ZIP Library
      - See Contributed Libraries
- [ ] Connect Arduino board with Computer USB to USB-C

### Arduino IDE will share libraires with both programs
- CAUTION: when installing libraries for first time, must restart Arduino
- Possible Prompt: update libraries NOT needed

---

# Second Step: Uploading Code to Car
- [ ] See Sketches/05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car/05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car.ino
- [ ] Choose the Board
      - Image 1
      - Search Uno
      - ```OK```
- [ ] Note: code will take about 30s or more to upload ( known as a fortnite )

---

# Third Step: Uploading Code to Controller
- [ ] See Sketches/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller.ino
- [ ] Same Uno Board Selection ...
      - Choose the Board
      - Image 1
      - Search Uno
      - ```OK```
- [ ] Note: code will take about 30s or more to upload ( known as a fortnite )

# To Include: Images
- [ ] TBA

### Troubleshooting
- Restart Arduino after libraries installed
- Update all libraries
- ```avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding```
      - Check Computer-USB for debre and nothing around car is conductive
- Interference from different remotes
