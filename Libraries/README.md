# First Step: Upload all libraries
- [ ] Open one of the programs below
      - Car Program: 05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car/05.4_Multifunctional_RF24_Remote_Car.ino
      - Remote Program: Sketches/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller/05.1_RF24_Remote_Controller.ino
- [ ] Sketch / Include Library / Add .ZIP Library
      - See Contributed Libraries
- [ ] Connect Arduino board with Computer USB to USB-C
- [ ] Choose the Board
      - Image 1
      - Search Uno
      - ```OK```

### Arduino IDE will share libraires with both programs
